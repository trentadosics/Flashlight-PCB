# Flashlight-PCB
*Welding workshop at FAB-Casa del Mig (Barcelona) - September 2023*

In collaboration with: FAB - Casa del Mig (Barcelona; Oriol Blas and Ricard GÃ³mez)

## Description
That was an educative project made to teach how to weld small electronic devices like LEDS, switches and battery holders on a fancy, useful and customizable flashlight PCB.

This design was modified several times, because of that you could see diferent versions in the photos' folder. However, the last one has a curved line on the upper side, instead of straight line.
