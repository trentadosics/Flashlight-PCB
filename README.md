# Flashlight-PCB
Soldering workshop at FAB-Casa del Mig (Barcelona) - September 2023

In collaboration with: FAB - Casa del Mig (Barcelona; Oriol Blas and Ricard GÃ³mez)

## Description
That was an educational project designed to teach soldering techniques for assembling small electronic components like LEDs, switches and battery holders onto a stylish, practical and customizable flashlight PCB

This design was modified several times, because of that you could see diferent versions in the photos' folder. However, the last one has a curved line on the upper side, instead of a straight line.

This design is also available on the PCBWay platform, ready to order and purchase if you needed.
